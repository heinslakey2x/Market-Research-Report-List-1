<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Infrared Thermometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact type</li><li>Contactless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial infrared thermometer market is primarily divided into two types: contact and contactless. Contact type thermometers measure temperature by direct contact with the object, providing precise readings but typically requiring surface access. In contrast, contactless or non-contact thermometers use infrared sensors to measure the thermal radiation emitted by an object from a distance, making them ideal for applications where direct contact is impractical, such as in hazardous environments or moving machinery. Both types cater to diverse industrial needs.</p></p>
