<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Respiratory Gas Humidifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Type</li><li>Passive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Respiratory Gas Humidifier market is split into two main types: active and passive. Active humidifiers use an external power source to heat water and create humidity, often incorporating features like temperature control to optimize patient comfort. In contrast, passive humidifiers rely on ambient temperature and the patient's own exhaled moisture to maintain humidity levels, making them simpler and often more cost-effective. Both types are essential for improving airway moisture and preventing complications during respiratory care.</p></p>
