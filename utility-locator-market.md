<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Utility Locator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electromagnetic Field</li><li>Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The utility locator market primarily consists of two key technologies: electromagnetic field (EMF) and ground penetrating radar (GPR). EMF locators detect buried conductive utilities using electromagnetic signals, making them effective for cables and pipes with conductive materials. GPR, on the other hand, employs radar pulses to visualize subsurface structures, providing detailed imaging of various materials, including those that are non-conductive. Both technologies play crucial roles in construction, excavation, and maintenance, enhancing safety and efficiency in utility management.</p></p>
