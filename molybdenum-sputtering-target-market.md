<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Molybdenum Sputtering Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Type</li><li>Non Rotatable Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The molybdenum sputtering target market is typically segmented into two main types: rotary and non-rotatable. Rotary targets are designed with a cylindrical shape that allows for continuous rotation during sputtering, enhancing uniformity and efficiency in coating applications. Non-rotatable targets, on the other hand, are fixed in position and are suitable for specific applications where rotation is not required. Both types cater to different manufacturing needs, with rotary targets often preferred for high-volume production due to their improved performance.</p></p>
